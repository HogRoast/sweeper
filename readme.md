# Footy prediction algorithm.

## Overview
This software consists of a number of python modules that can be used to analyse historic football results and betting history and predict key futures matches to bet on.

## Usage
Currently the files described in the Source Modules section below can be run interactively as individual python scripts, eventually the aim is to cover them with a REST API and be able to call them from a HTML client.
 
## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Config Files - config directory
The following config file is a template for the footy.ini file that is required by the AnalyseFixtures module to email results to interested parties, it contains mail addresses and algo config parameters.

```
example.footy.ini
```

Modify the mail parameters to specify an appropriate mail sever and distribution list and save the result as 'footy.ini' under the config directory. Modify the algo parameters to specify which leagues you wish to run the algos over and what marks to use for prediction, also allows for configuration of the number of seasons to be included in analysis.

## Source Modules - src directory
### MakeFootyHistory 
Downloads latest football historical data from [Football-Data](www.football-data.co.uk). This script runs the historical analysis and generates the summary statistics for each league in the rangeMap specified in thse ini file (see later). This must be run before running AnalyseFixtures or FootyBackTest.

### AnalyseFixtures 
Downloads the latest fixture list from [Football-Data](www.football-data.co.uk) it uses the same historical data generated by MakeFootyHistory and creates predictions based on the selected 'model'. Output is placed in the 'analysisDir'. Running with -s option will send an email of the predictions to the addresses specified in file named footy.ini (not included in repo, however you will find example.footy.ini from which can be used as a template).

### FootyBacktest
Can be used to run backtest of the selected model over the historical data specified in the rangeMap (see .ini).

### FootyAnalysisTools 
Defines the models and the analysis output directory.

### DownloadData
Can be used to download the raw historical data from [Football-Data](www.football-data.co.uk).

### Logging 
This module defines a simple log functionality that can be switched on and off via command line args.
